# PyCleanArch - Python Clean Architecture

A simple Python toolkit to work with Clean Architecture for Web. This code base is inspired by [liasis from Johnny Well](https://github.com/johnnywell/liasis/). 

Use this toolkit to build better applications implementing [Clean Architecture from Robert C. Martin](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)

## Requirements
